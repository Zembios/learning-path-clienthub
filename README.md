# Learning Path â€“ Full Repo
Welcome! This is the full multi-unit learning path with concise theory, single-function topic tasks, unit-level tasks, and tests.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm i
# Run a specific unit
npm run test:unit1
# Or run everything
npm test
# (TypeScript checks for Unit 3 as well)
npm run typecheck
```

```

## Convenient theory display
All theory is written in markdown and there are plenty of markdown visualizers/previewers available. In fact, VS Code has a built-in md previewer (`Ctrl+K V` to preview when viewing a md file).

## React Tasks
You can use this React sandbox for your convenience:
https://codesandbox.io/s/react-new

You will probably have to import different native hooks from React manually in the sandbox. For example:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

### Notes on Warnings
You might see npm WARN deprecations from transitive tooling. Safe to ignore for this training repo.
