# Unit 3 â€“ TypeScript Foundations
This unit's tasks are more of an example for use cases, not so much something to work out a solution for. 

Going through the unit-level theory is absolutely enough. If you'd like to see some specific use cases - the individual topics' tasks have them for you.

**Implement the unit task** in: `./src/task/solution.ts`  
**Run tests:** `npm run test:unit3`

This unit also includes per-topic exercises under `./topics/` (each has its own `theory+task.md`, `src/solution.ts`, and tests).
