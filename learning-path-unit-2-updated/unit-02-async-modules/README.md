# Unit 2 – Asynchronous JS & Modules

**Implement the unit task** in: `./src/task/solution.js`  
**Run tests:** `npm run test:unit2`

## How to run locally

1. Install deps (Node 18+ recommended):
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
2. Run all tests for this unit:
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit2
   ```

The unit includes per‑topic exercises under `./topics/` (each has its own `theory+task.md`, `src/solution.js`, and tests).

> Note: The tests mock the global `fetch`, so they do not perform real network calls.
